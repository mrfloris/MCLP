        Feel free to <code><?= $server_discord_owner1 ?></code> or <code><?= $server_discord_owner2 ?></code> to ask a question, but we do have a -community- category where it's perhaps more appropriate to discuss ban-appeals, ask support questions, or apply for staff, etc. We invite you to explore our discord community server.
